<h1>Josh's Top Movie Recommendations</h1>
<h2>My favorite 3 movies to enjoy.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>Everything about this movie is perfection: the animation, the soundtrack, the story and the action. It's the closest thing to a flawless movie.</p>
<h3>Baby Driver</h3>
<p>Again, amazing soundtrack. And, the filmography by Edgar Wright is genius.</p>
<h3>Logan</h3>
<p>Gotta have a superhero movie, and this one is a premiere adaptation of an all-time favorite character.</p>
